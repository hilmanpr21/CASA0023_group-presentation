# Methodology

???

All text under the three question marks are presentation notes; it is hidden from the presentation slides and only available in presenter mode.

---

# Methodology



```{r image, echo=FALSE, out.width='80%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('img/methodology-flowchart.png')
```

# Methodology

'Ensemble-based' Machine Learning approach

1. Using database of historic flood data, split into training (70%) and testing (30%) set  

--

1. Build a map (raster) of each hazard input parameter  

--

1. Estimate flood probability indices (Frequency Ratio Approach)  

--

1. Apply a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model, which will classify the input pixels   

--

1. Build a map (raster) of each vulnerability input parameter, classified on a quantile scale

--

1. Combine the hazard and vulnerability maps together to produce single risk index

--

1. Validate the model using testing set of data

# Hello World

Install the **xaringan** package from [Github](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan):

```{r eval=FALSE, tidy=FALSE}
remotes::install_github("yihui/xaringan")
```

--

You are recommended to use the [RStudio IDE](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/), but you do not have to.

- Create a new R Markdown document from the menu `File -> New File -> R Markdown -> From Template -> Ninja Presentation`;<sup>1</sup>

---

# Hello Ninja

As a presentation ninja, you certainly should not be satisfied by the "Hello World" example. You need to understand more about two things:

1. The [remark.js](https://remarkjs.com) library;

1. The **xaringan** package;

Basically **xaringan** injected the chakra of R Markdown (minus Pandoc) into **remark.js**. The slides are rendered by remark.js in the web browser, and the Markdown source needed by remark.js is generated from R Markdown (**knitr**).

---

# Tables

If you want to generate a table, make sure it is in the HTML format (instead of Markdown or other formats), e.g.,

```{r}
knitr::kable(head(iris), format = 'html')
```

---

```{r eval=require('DT'), tidy=FALSE}
DT::datatable(
  head(iris, 10),
  fillContainer = FALSE, options = list(pageLength = 8)
)
```

---

# Themes

Don't want to learn CSS? Okay, you can use some user-contributed themes. A theme typically consists of two CSS files `foo.css` and `foo-fonts.css`, where `foo` is the theme name. Below are some existing themes:

```{r, R.options=list(width = 70)}
names(xaringan:::list_css())
```

---

# Themes

To use a theme, you can specify the `css` option as an array of CSS filenames (without the `.css` extensions), e.g.,

```yaml
output:
  xaringan::moon_reader:
    css: [default, metropolis, metropolis-fonts]
```

If you want to contribute a theme to **xaringan**, please read [this blog post](https://yihui.org/en/2017/10/xaringan-themes).

# Thanks!

Slides created via the R package [**xaringan**](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan).

The chakra comes from [remark.js](https://remarkjs.com), [**knitr**](https://yihui.org/knitr/), and [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com).
