  abstract = {The disaster risks have been increasing recently due to the emergence of climate-related hazards which cause problems especially in coastal cities. Although the risks are obvious, many cities in Indonesia do not seem to have enough capacity to cope with the challenges. The study is aimed to assess the current capacity of disaster governance in Semarang. It is argued that well-structured governance is still key issue in the city. By adopting qualitative approach and using institutional analysis as the main instrument, it is found that there are still gaps in the capacity among those who involve in that process.},

  abstract = {Flood is a natural disaster that occurs when water accumulates excessively to cover the land. Semarang is the capital in and largest city of Central Java that often experiences flooding causing casualties and damage. A disaster mitigation strategy is required to minimize losses in the future. One of the mitigation strategies that can be done is analysing prone areas to flooding in Semarang. The purpose of this study is to determine the level of prone area to flood disaster in Semarang by integrating the Geographic Information System (GIS) and remote sensing data including soil type, slope, rainfall data from the imaging satellite Himawari 8, land cover using Landsat 8 OLI, and observation data of catastrophic events in the last five years. The results obtained showed the prone area in Semarang was 44.25\% and 8.18\% in conditions of very prone, and 47.54\% were in the condition of not prone to quite prone. Flood management through environmental adaptation of the community, design and construction of flood-resistant infrastructure by development codes can help to deal with the impact of flood damage. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

Struktur geologi yang cukup mencolok di wilayah Kota Semarang berupa kelurusan-kelurusan dan kontak batuan yang tegas merupakan pencerminan struktur sesar baik geser mendatar dan normal cukup berkembang di bagian tengah dan selatan kota. Sehingga sering terjadi bencana alam salah satunya tanah longsor. Dengan itu maka di buat pemetaan bencana tanah longsor guna mengurangi kerugian akibat bencana melalui peta.  ~~~~~~~~~~~ Pada pembuatan peta risiko bencana tanah longsor ini dilakukan dengan beberapa tahapan yaitu pemodelan peta ancaman, pemodelan kerentanan, pemodelan kapasitas, serta pemodelan risiko. Pemodelan ancaman dihasilkan dari pembobotan menggunakan overlay. Pemodelan kerentanan dan kapsitas dihasilkan mengacu pada telaah dokumen dengan penilaian kerentanan menggunakan pembobotan. Sedangkan pada pemodelan peta risiko diproses dengan menggunakan rumusan Peraturan Kepala Badan Penanggulangan Bencana Alam (PERKA BNPB) No. 2 Tahun 2012 dan VCA (Vulnerability Capacity Analysis) modifikasi untuk mementukan klasifikasi risiko bencana tanah longsor.  Hasil penelitian untuk menentukan pemodelan risiko bencana tanah longsor menggunakan metode matriks penentuan kelas sesuai dengan rumusan VCA modifikasi menghasilkan risiko rendah seluas 126,003 hektar di delapan kelurahan, tingkat risiko sedang seluas 323,141 hektar di sepuluh kelurahan dan lima belas kelurahan pada 475,127 hektar ditingkat risiko tinggi.   Kata Kunci :   Bencana Tanah Longsor, Peta Risiko, VCA    ~     ABSTRACT     Semarang   city is the capital province of Central Java, Indonesia, which is one of the major cities in Indonesia. Geological structure that is quite striking in the Semarang city is in the form of straightness and firm rock contact that is the reflection of the fault structure both horizontal and normal shear are fairly developed in the central and southern parts of the city. So it frequently occur natural disasters one of them is landslides. So they developed a mapping of landslides in order to reduce disaster losses through the map.      In the   making of landslide risk map, it is done in several stages, namely the threat map modeling, vulnerability modeling, capacity modeling, and risk modeling. Threat modeling result from the weighting using the overlay. ~Vulnerabilities and capacities modeling refer to the study of documents generated by the vulnerability assessment using weighting. While in risk map modeling, it is processed by using the Regulation Head of Disaster Management (Perka BNPB) No. 2 In 2012 formula and the VCA (Vulnerability Capacity Analysis) modifications to determine the risk classification of landslides.      The results of   the study is to determine the risk of landslides using the grading matrix formulation in accordance with the VCA modification produces a low risk area of 126  ,  003   hectares in eight villages, the level of risk covered 323  ,  141   hectares in ten villages and fifteen villages in 475  ,  127   hectares of high risk level.

  abstract = {This study explores urbanization and flood events in the northern coast of Central Java with river basin as its unit of analysis. Two types of analysis were applied (i.e., spatial data and non-spatial data analysis) at four river basin areas in Central Java—Indonesia. The spatial analysis is focused on the assessment of LULC change in 2009–2018 based on Landsat Imagery. The non-spatial data (i.e., rural-urban classification and flood events) were overlaid with results of spatial data analyses. Our findings show that urbanization, as indicated by the growth rate of built-up areas, is very significant. Notable exposure to flood has taken place in the urban and potentially urban areas. The emerging discussion indicates that river basins possess dual spatial identity in the urban system (policy- and land-use-related). Proper land use planning and control is an essential instrument to safeguard urban areas (such as the case study area) and the entire island of Java in Indonesia. More attention should be put upon the river basin areas in designing eco-based approach to tackle the urban flood crises. In this case, the role of governance in flood management is crucial.},

  abstract = {In this paper, an ensemble method, which demonstrated efficiency in GIS based flood modeling, was used to create flood probability indices for the Damansara River catchment in Malaysia. To estimate flood probability, the frequency ratio (FR) approach was combined with support vector machine (SVM) using a radial basis function kernel. Thirteen flood conditioning parameters, namely, altitude, aspect, slope, curvature, stream power index, topographic wetness index, sediment transport index, topographic roughness index, distance from river, geology, soil, surface runoff, and land use/cover (LULC), were selected. Each class of conditioning factor was weighted using the FR approach and entered as input for SVM modeling to optimize all the parameters. The flood hazard map was produced by combining the flood probability map with flood-triggering factors such as; averaged daily rainfall and flood inundation depth. Subsequently, the hydraulic 2D high-resolution sub-grid model (HRS) was applied to estimate the flood inundation depth. Furthermore, vulnerability weights were assigned to each element at risk based on their importance. Finally flood risk map was generated. The results of this research demonstrated that the proposed approach would be effective for flood risk management in the study area along the expressway and could be easily replicated in other areas. © 2017 The Author(s).

  abstract = {Satellite remote sensing is a powerful tool to map flooded areas. In recent years, the availability of free satellite data significantly increased in terms of type and frequency, allowing the production of flood maps at low cost around the world. In this work, we propose a semi-automatic method for flood mapping, based only on free satellite images and open-source software. The proposed methods are suitable to be applied by the community involved in flood hazard management, not necessarily experts in remote sensing processing. As case studies, we selected three flood events that recently occurred in Spain and Italy. Multispectral satellite data acquired by MODIS, Proba-V, Landsat, and Sentinel-2 and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data collected by Sentinel-1 were used to detect flooded areas using different methodologies (e.g., Modified Normalized Difference Water Index, SAR backscattering variation, and supervised classification). Then, we improved and manually refined the automatic mapping using free ancillary data such as the digital elevation model-based water depth model and available ground truth data. We calculated flood detection performance (flood ratio) for the different datasets by comparing with flood maps made by official river authorities. The results show that it is necessary to consider different factors when selecting the best satellite data. Among these factors, the time of the satellite pass with respect to the flood peak is the most important. With co-flood multispectral images, more than 90\% of the flooded area was detected in the 2015 Ebro flood (Spain) case study. With post-flood multispectral data, the flood ratio showed values under 50\% a few weeks after the 2016 flood in Po and Tanaro plains (Italy), but it remained useful to map the inundated pattern. The SAR could detect flooding only at the co-flood stage, and the flood ratio showed values below 5\% only a few days after the 2016 Po River inundation. Another result of the research was the creation of geomorphology-based inundation maps that matched up to 95\% with official flood maps.},

  abstract = {Semarang merupakan salah satu Kota besar di pulau Jawa yang mempunyai tingkat kebencanaan yang cukup tinggi. Salah satu bencana alam yang sekarang ini masih sering terjadi dan memberikan dampak negatif bagi masyarakat Kota Semarang adalah banjir pasang atau banjir rob. Atas dasar tersebut, perlunya dilakukan penyusunan peta risiko untuk mengurangi kerugian yang ditimbulkan oleh banjir rob. Pemetaan risiko merupakan proses pemetaan yang memberikan gambaran potensi dampak negatif yang mengakibatkan kerugian dari ancaman bahaya suatu bencana pada suatu wilayah. Dengan adanya peta risiko banjir rob, diharapkan pemerintah dan masyarakat Kota Semarang lebih siap dan waspada dalam mengatasi bencana banjir rob. Hasil peta risiko perlu disosialisasikan melalui suatu sistem yang mudah diakses dan digunakan untuk kepentingan masyarakat umum. Dalam penyusunan peta risiko banjir rob ini disusun untuk rencana sampai tahun 2015, dengan melakukan serangkaian tahapan yaitu pemodelan ancaman banjir rob, pemodelan kerentanan, dan pemodelan risiko. Pemodelan ancaman dihasilkan melalui pemodelan genangan banjir rob dari parameter penurunan tanah dan nilai HHWL (Highest High Water Level). Pemodelan kerentanan dihasilkan mengacu pada telaah dokumen dengan penilaian kerentanan menggunakan pendekatan pembobotan dan metode fuzzy logic. Untuk pemodelan risiko diproses dengan menggunakan rumusan VCA (Vulnerability Capacity Analysis) dan modifikasi rumusan penilaian risiko dari Peraturan Kepala Badan Penanggulangan Bencana Alam (PERKA BNPB) No. 2 Tahun 2012 untuk mendapatkan klasifikasi risiko banjir rob. Selanjutnya, sistem yang mengakomodasi hasil peta risiko tersebut dibuat berbasis online yang mampu memberikan kemudahan bagi penggunanya dalam menangkap informasi risiko banjir rob dan dapat mengunduh data spasial hasil peta risiko tersebut. Hasil yang dicapai dalam penelitian ini bahwa besarnya ancaman banjir rob Kota Semarang untuk prediksi tahun 2015 yaitu seluas 8.339,31 hektar atau menggenangi 22,32\% dari total wilayah Kota Semarang yang tersebar di 9 kecamatan dan 73 kelurahan. Untuk pemodelan risiko banjir rob menggunakan metode matriks penentuan kelas sesuai dengan rumusan VCA menghasilkan risiko rendah seluas 218,17 hektar di 15 kelurahan, risiko sedang seluas 1.116,38 hektar di 48 kelurahan, dan risiko tinggi seluas 6.671,36 hektar di 61 kelurahan. Kemudian dalam implementasi untuk menyebarluaskan informasi sekaligus sharing data dari pemetaan risiko tersebut, dalam penelitian ini dibangun sistem peta online yang bersifat statis interaktif dengan pemakaian Google Maps dan format data spasial KML (Keyhole Markup Language). Sistem yang dibangun tersebut mempunyai nilai 96,53\% dari hasil uji usability sehingga dapat dikatakan bahwa Peta Online Risiko Banjir Rob Kota Semarang efektif, efisien, dan cukup memberikan kepuasan bagi penggunanya. Semarang is one of the largest cities in Java island that is very prone to tidal flood or locally known as â€˜banjir robâ€™. In order to reduce the tidal flood risk, disaster managers and city planners need a well-planned natural disaster risk management method based on disaster risk map of the city area. Risk mapping alone is not enough, an efficient system to disseminate the result of risk mapping for general public is also needed. This work intends to solve a problem of arrangement and presentation of tidal flood risk mapping. In order to develop the disaster risk map, the validation and prediction of the tidal flood were done to produce a hazard map on the tidal flood. Subsequently, the maps of vulnerability and capacity of the study area were produced based upon VCA (Vulnerability Capacity Analysis) by using fuzzy logic and weighted method approaches. As a comparison to that, the calculation of tidal flood risk was also done by addopting to the regulation of The Natural Disaster Risk Management Head / Kepala Badan Penanggulangan Bencana Alam (PERKA BNPB) No. 2 year 2012. Finally, the risk map online was designed and developed. This system facilities the function of information dissemination and spatial data download of the risk map result. The result suggests that the risk for tidal flood in Semarang for the year of 2015 is 8.339,31 hectares, flooding 22,32\% of the total Semarang areas in 9 sub districts of 73 community areas. From the risk assessments using VCA formulation, it can be concluded that the low risk is on 15 community areas (218,17 hectares), intermediate risk on 48 community areas (1.116,38 hectares), and high risk on another 61 areas (6.671,36 hectares). In addition to this, the research also concludes that the use of topographics map, landsubsidence map, and tide \& tidal data in modeling hazard; the use of fuzzy logic method in modeling vulnerability; and the use of weighted method approach in modeling capacity can give a good result for supporting tidal flood risk assessments in Semarang city. In regard to the research dissemination, this work has successfully built an application of a static interactive online map namely Online Map of Tidal Flood Risk Semarang City. The online map uses KML format for sharing spatial data attributes and uses Google Maps as the map engine. The online map also gets good responses through a usability test, where about 96,53\% of the respondenses say this system is successfull. Thus it can be concluded the online map is effective, efficient, and satisfactory to users.}

One of the sub-districts in the city of Semarang, which is included in the tidal flood-prone area in every years, is the North Semarang Sub-District. The area of tidal flood is 55.95 Ha and the data of estimated generation of tidal flood waste in the North Semarang Sub-District is +/- 70 tons. Lack of planning for handling waste disasters, especially for tidal flood waste, is a challenge related to environmental and economic impacts that occur at tidal flood sites. This study aims to examine the quantification of the cost of handling tidal flood waste using quantitative descriptive analysis cost accounting calculation method. The calculation is done by considering several things, namely the activity of handling waste, the need for handling waste, as well as the calculation of the cost of handling tidal flood waste. The total cost of handling tidal flood waste in North Semarang Sub-District is IDR 14,209,324,000/year or IDR 1,184,110,333/month. The results of the calculation of the overall cost are then divided by the area of the tidal flood so that the unit cost of handling waste per m2 is IDR 2,117/m2.},

  abstract = {Climate change becomes a big problem for Semarang City. One of the effects of climate change in Semarang City is the tidal flooding (rob). The existing tidal flooding is a consequence of the increase of land surface subsidence and the rise of sea level. It affects many aspects of life and livelihood of the society, including on physical, social, economic, environmental, and health aspects. In 2012, MercyCorps and ARUP declared Semarang City as one of the cities resilience to climate change. In 2014, Semarang City became the only city in Indonesia to take part in the 100 Resilient Cities program (100 RC). This research aims to identify the measures that have been done by stakeholders in facing tidal flood and to measure the resilience level of Semarang City in encountering tidal flood. The location of this research covers the area along the coast of Semarang City which stretches from west to east as far as 13.6 km. This research uses quantitative-qualitative deductive method. Based on the analysis result, the measures that have been done by the stakeholders in Semarang City resulted in “medium” resilience level against tidal flood. This implies that Semarang City has not yet been resilient in facing tidal flood. However, the existence of the 100RC program has made Semarang City Government work harder to achieve the goal of the 100RC project, which is Semarang City that is resilient in facing all challenges, both in the form of shock and stress.}

  abstract = {Estimating flood risks and managing disasters combines knowledge in climatology, meteorology, hydrology, hydraulic engineering, statistics, planning and geography – thus a complex multi-faceted problem. This study focuses on the capabilities of multi-source remote sensing data to support decision-making before, during and after a flood event. With our focus on urbanized areas, sample methods and applications show multi-scale products from the hazard and vulnerability perspective of the risk framework. From the hazard side, we present capabilities with which to assess flood-prone areas before an expected disaster. Then we map the spatial impact during or after a flood and finally, we analyze damage grades after a flood disaster. From the vulnerability side, we monitor urbanization over time on an urban footprint level, classify urban structures on an individual building level, assess building stability and quantify probably affected people. The results show a large database for sustainable development and for developing mitigation strategies, ad-hoc coordination of relief measures and organizing rehabilitation.},

  abstract = {Flood is one of the most devastating natural disasters that occur frequently in Terengganu, Malaysia. Recently, ensemble based techniques are getting extremely popular in flood modeling. In this paper, weights-of-evidence (WoE) model was utilized first, to assess the impact of classes of each conditioning factor on flooding through bivariate statistical analysis (BSA). Then, these factors were reclassified using the acquired weights and entered into the support vector machine (SVM) model to evaluate the correlation between flood occurrence and each conditioning factor. Through this integration, the weak point of WoE can be solved and the performance of the SVM will be enhanced. The spatial database included flood inventory, slope, stream power index (SPI), topographic wetness index (TWI), altitude, curvature, distance from the river, geology, rainfall, land use/cover (LULC), and soil type. Four kernel types of SVM (linear kernel (LN), polynomial kernel (PL), radial basis function kernel (RBF), and sigmoid kernel (SIG)) were used to investigate the performance of each kernel type. The efficiency of the new ensemble WoE and SVM method was tested using area under curve (AUC) which measured the prediction and success rates. The validation results proved the strength and efficiency of the ensemble method over the individual methods. The best results were obtained from RBF kernel when compared with the other kernel types. Success rate and prediction rate for ensemble WoE and RBF-SVM method were 96.48\% and 95.67\% respectively. The proposed ensemble flood susceptibility mapping method could assist researchers and local governments in flood mitigation strategies. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {Flooding affects more people than any other environmental hazard and hinders sustainable development1,2. Investing in flood adaptation strategies may reduce the loss of life and livelihood caused by floods3. Where and how floods occur and who is exposed are changing as a result of rapid urbanization4, flood mitigation infrastructure5 and increasing settlements in floodplains6. Previous estimates of the global flood-exposed population have been limited by a lack of observational data, relying instead on models, which have high uncertainty3,7–11. Here we use daily satellite imagery at 250-metre resolution to estimate flood extent and population exposure for 913 large flood events from 2000 to 2018. We determine a total inundation area of 2.23 million square kilometres, with 255–290 million people directly affected by floods. We estimate that the total population in locations with satellite-observed inundation grew by 58–86 million from 2000 to 2015. This represents an increase of 20 to 24 per cent in the proportion of the global population exposed to floods, ten times higher than previous estimates7. Climate change projections for 2030 indicate that the proportion of the population exposed to floods will increase further. The high spatial and temporal resolution of the satellite observations will improve our understanding of where floods are changing and how best to adapt. The global flood database generated from these observations will help to improve vulnerability assessments, the accuracy of global and local flood models, the efficacy of adaptation interventions and our understanding of the interactions between landcover change, climate and floods.},

  abstract = {Semarang City is the capital of Central Java province, located in the northern coast of Java island, Indonesia which is geologically composed of alluvial deposits. The natural consolidation of young alluvial deposits has caused a land subsidence. On the other hand, load of buildings and constructions causes an increase in the pressure of land surface, and finally, leads to an increase in the rate of land subsidence. The drilling data indicated that not all layers of lithology are soft layers supporting the land subsidence. A research on the depth of soft litology and its percentage of hard lithology has not been conducted ever before. On the other side, an analysis regarding this kind of research can be conducted based on resistivity method. Sounding system method with Schlumberger electrode configuration was selected for field data collection. The goals of this research were to determine the resitivity of lithology so that it can be used to interpretate distribution of depth and clay-silt to sand ratio of land subsidence area. The results showed that the area with the depth of the upper layer of clay-silt less than 3 m and clay-silt to sand ratio less than 4 were the high land subsidence area.}
